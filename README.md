This repository is for a course project in ESS 511 Geophysical Continuum Mechanics.

The project is on radar methods in glaciology. I develop a simple model that numerically solves Maxwell's Equations with a method called finite-difference-time-domain. Within the repository are:

1-dimensional model
2-dimensional model
paper summarizing results and discussing applications

The modeling scripts are written in python and should be usable with the standard libraries.
