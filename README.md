This repository is for a course project in ESS 511 Geophysical Continuum Mechanics.

The project is on radar methods in glaciology. I develop a simple model that numerically solves Maxwell's Equations with a method called finite-difference-time-domain. Within the repository are files for a:

- 1-dimensional model

- 2-dimensional model

- paper summarizing results and discussing applications

The modeling scripts are written in python and should be usable with the standard libraries.
