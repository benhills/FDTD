abstract = {We analyzed depth patterns of geometrically corrected returned power Pc from within the ice of central West Antarctica to develop a proxy for englacial radar attenuation. The depth patterns of$\backslash$n[Pc]dB (Pc in the decibel scale) at individual sites were first approximated with least squares vertical gradients of the local mean$\backslash$n[Pc]dB for five depth ranges. Variations of these gradients along radar tracks show identifiable trends but have local anomalous$\backslash$nfeatures over distances less than ∼5–10 km that are caused by smaller reflection from tilted internal layers above steep beds$\backslash$nand other factors. Consequently, extraction of an attenuation proxy from the returned power requires mitigation of reflectivity$\backslash$nvariations. Next, returned power was synthesized only from bright layers assembled over distances much wider than the local$\backslash$nanomalous features. Individual data ensembles show a clear upper (not lower) cutoff in [Pc]dB. The cutoff power decreases with depth linearly between ∼500 and ∼1600 m, which defines the upper envelope gradient. With$\backslash$nthe aid of attenuation and reflectivity modeling, we concluded that the upper envelope gradient can be an attenuation proxy$\backslash$nin the isothermal ice that is expected in the upper half or more of central West Antarctica. The estimated attenuation rate$\backslash$nin the upper ∼1600 m varies 5 dB km−1 (one way), equivalent to lateral temperature variations of about 2°C or chemistry variations of up to a factor of 2. This$\backslash$nrange indicates that the attenuation variations can significantly affect delineation of bed wetness on the basis of contrasts$\backslash$nin power returned from the bed.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {[1] We describe a novel technique for measuring the basal melt rate at a point on an ice shelf. The method uses a phase-sensitive radar to observe the change in thickness of the ice column between an upper reference horizon and the ice shelf base. The observed thickness change is a combination of basal melting, horizontal ice divergence and firn compaction. The latter two components are determined independently by the repeat survey of surface markers and from estimates of surface accumulation rate and density at the depth of the reference horizon. The technique has been applied at a site on George VI Ice Shelf, Antarctica, where a melt rate of 2.78 +/- 0.08 m yr(-1) was observed over a twelve-day period. Our technique is applicable to almost any ice shelf or floating glacier tongue, and its high precision over short time intervals will permit the measurement of seasonal variations in melt rate.},

abstract = {[ 1] Analysis of coherent radar sounding echoes from polar ice sheets can provide information suitable for classifying the subglacial environment. Echoes from a general interface consist of both specularly reflected and diffusely scattered contributions. Specular reflection results from smooth uniform interfaces, whereas diffuse scattering results from rough nonuniform interfaces and inhomogeneous media. This article discusses how these phenomena are important to the acquisition and analysis of coherent radar sounding data. Reflection results are presented from airborne surveys conducted in 1987 over the downstream portions of Whillans Ice Stream and Ice Stream C, West Antarctica. Additionally, reflection and scattering analyses along with new results are presented for repeat profiles flown in 2001 over Ice Stream C. Analysis methods include using echo amplitudes to compute reflection coefficients which are used for inferring the dielectric properties of the subglacial material. Echo phase analysis provides the locations of dominant scattering centers which relate to reflection or scattering from the interface as well as provide interface roughness estimates. Comparison of low- and high-resolution imaging obtained from synthetic aperture radar techniques indicates a reflecting and/or scattering interface. Combining the results from these independent analyses provides classification of the subglacial environment. Classified regions include smooth seawater, smooth saturated sediments, accreted marine ice, rough bottom crevasses, mixed conditions with partial subglacial water, and dry frozen conditions.},

This subglacial estuary consists of a hydropotential low upstream of the grounding zone, which is linked to the ocean by a hydropotential trough and a large subglacial channel. This subglacial channel, which is imaged using active source seismic methods, has an apparent width of 1 km and a maximum depth of 7 m.

abstract = {The radar reflectivity of an ice-sheet bed is a primary measurement for discriminating between thawed and frozen beds. Uncertainty in englacial radar attenuation and its spatial variation introduces corresponding uncertainty in estimates of basal reflectivity. Radar attenuation is proportional to ice conductivity, which depends on the concentrations of acid and sea-salt chloride and the temperature of the ice. We synthesize published conductivity measurements to specify an ice-conductivity model and find that some of the dielectric properties of ice at radar frequencies are not yet well constrained. Using depth profiles of ice-core chemistry and borehole temperature and an average of the experimental values for the dielectric properties, we calculate an attenuation rate profile for Siple Dome, West Antarctica. The depth-averaged modeled attenuation rate at Siple Dome (20.0 ± 5.7 dB km1) is somewhat lower than the value derived from radar profiles (25.3 ± 1.1 dB km1). Pending more experimental data on the dielectric properties of ice, we can match the modeled and radar-derived attenuation rates by an adjustment to the value for the pure ice conductivity that is within the range of reported values. Alternatively, using the pure ice dielectric properties derived from the most extensive single data set, the modeled depth-averaged attenuation rate is 24.0 ± 2.2 dB km1. This work shows how to calculate englacial radar attenuation using ice chemistry and temperature data and establishes a basis for mapping spatial variations in radar attenuation across an ice sheet.},

abstract = {[1] We collected 1850 km of ground-based radio echo-sounding (RES) data in West Antarctica along the 2001 US leg of the International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition traverse (US-ITASE). These data represent the first high-resolution measurements of ice thickness and internal stratigraphy for portions of this area that bear on questions about the stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). Internal layers depicting isochrones have been traced continuously for much of the profile length and a date from the Byrd Deep Core is ascribed to one of these isochrones from which we estimate vertical velocities across the traverse route. Comparison of our ice thickness measurements with BEDMAP show good agreement in regions where the database is well constrained by data coverage. Where the BEDMAP dataset was forced to interpolate, differences are as high as 45{\%} of the ice thickness.},

abstract = {Radio-echo sounding (RES), utilizing a variety of radio frequencies, was developed to allow glaciologists to measure the thickness of ice sheets and glaciers. We review the nature of electromagnetic wave propagation in ice and snow, including the permittivity of ice, signal attenuation and volume scattering, along with reflection from rough and specular surfaces. The variety of instruments used in RES of polar ice sheets and temperate glaciers is discussed. The applications and insights that a knowledge of ice thickness, and the wider nature of the form and flow of ice sheets, provides are also considered. The thickest ice measured is 4.7 km in East Antarctica. The morphology of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, and many of the smaller ice caps and glaciers of the polar regions, has been investigated using RES. These findings are being used in three-dimensional numerical models of the response of the cryosphere to environmental change. In addition, the distribution and character of internal and basal reflectors within ice sheets contains information on, for example, ice-sheet layering and its chrono-stratigraphic significance, and has enabled the discovery and investigation of large lakes beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Today, RES from ground-based and airborne platforms remains the most effective tool for measuring ice thickness and internal character.},

abstract = {Ice stratigraphy from deep-penetrating radar data collected during the 2002 US International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition (US-ITASE) traverse shows evidence of a significant erosion surface and drift-filled basin related to a previously undiscovered 1400 m subglacial mountain between Hercules Dome (87 degrees 42'S, 108 degrees W) and South Pole. The 3 MHz radar profile crosses three subglacial mountains at approximately 45 degrees to the ice-flow direction. Cross-cutting reflectors in the top 500 m of ice stratigraphy are interpreted as angular unconformities resulting from wind erosion as the ice deforms over the mountain tops. The unconformities correlate locally with zones of high RADARSAT reflectivity. Several nearby sites with similar relatively high RADARSAT reflectivity adjacent to the traverse indicate that active wind erosion may be taking place at these locations as well. Based on the local correlation between surface wind scour and subglacial topography, we interpret the nearby cluster of bright RADARSAT reflectivity to indicate the presence of a small range of subglacial mountains. The ability to trace isochronal stratigraphy, associated with scour sites using shallow and deep radar, to nearby dated ice cores presents the possibility of exploiting wind-scour zones to access well-dated older ice with shallow-coring equipment.},

abstract = {Ice-penetrating radar and kinematic GPS observations from Subglacial Lake Whillans (SLW), West Antarctica, reveal a shallow lake that is confined by steep basal topographic features. Radar imaging of SLW, although indicating wet basal conditions, is consistent with a water column depth of only {\~{}}. 6. m or less during the near low-stand state at the time of the survey. Kinematic GPS profiles reveal that SLW is generally defined by a {\~{}}. 15. m surface depression centered at S 84.237?? W 153.614??. This point coincides with the area of lowest hydropotential in the lake basin and also the largest surface elevation range in ICESat data. Therefore this location appears to be an opportune site for subglacial access drilling of this active subglacial lake. A distinct basal topographic ridge on the grid south side of the basin is coincident with a strong contrast in relative basal reflectivity ({\~{}}. 6. dB), which we interpret as the lake boundary. Mapped hydropotential (calculated assuming hydrostatic equilibrium) shows that water enters the lake from the upstream direction and drains downstream. We hypothesize that a lake-level rise of {\~{}}. 5. m plus flexural effects is sufficient to overtop a drainage divide. Thus SLW acts as a temporary storage basin for water beneath Whillans Ice Stream. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Here we detail a technique to estimate Q and apply it to active source seismic data from Jakobshavn Isbrae, Greenland. We compare our results to measured and modeled temperature profiles of the ice in the region. We find an excellent match, with differences between seismically estimated and modeled temperatures of less than 2C. Mapping variations in seismic Q through glacial ice thus is shown to allow detailed estimation of englacial temperature profiles, which may be of special value in regions where in situ measurements are logistically difficult.},

@article{Catania2010,
abstract = {Surface melting on the Greenland Ice Sheet is common up to 1400 m elevation and, in extreme melt years, even higher. Water produced on the ice sheet surface collects in lakes and drains over the ice sheet surface via supraglacial streams and through the ice sheet via moulins. Water delivered to the base of the ice sheet can cause uplift and enhanced sliding locally. Here we use ice-penetrating radar data to observe the effects of significant basal melting coincident with moulins and calculate how much basal melt occurred. We find that more melting has occurred than can be explained by the release of potential energy from the drainage of surface meltwater during one melt season suggesting that these moulins are persistent for multiple years. We find only a few persistent moulins in our study area that drain the equivalent of multiple lakes per year and likely remain active over several years. Our observations indicate that once established, these persistent moulins might be capable of establishing well-connected meltwater drainage pathways.},
